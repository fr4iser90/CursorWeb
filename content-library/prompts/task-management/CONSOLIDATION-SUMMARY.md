# Task Management Prompts - Consolidation Summary

## Consolidation Results

### ✅ **Completed Consolidations**

#### 1. **Merged `task-review-phases.md` into `task-review.md`**
- **Action**: Deleted `task-review-phases.md` (95% overlap)
- **Result**: `task-review.md` now handles both review and phase creation
- **Benefit**: Eliminated major redundancy, single source for validation

#### 2. **Simplified `task-check-state.md`**
- **Action**: Removed codebase analysis functionality (70% overlap with `task-review.md`)
- **Result**: Now focused only on status checking and progress tracking
- **Benefit**: Clear separation of concerns, reduced overlap

#### 3. **Clarified `task-analyze.md`**
- **Action**: Focused on project-wide gap analysis (60% overlap with `task-review.md`)
- **Result**: Now specifically for project-wide analysis, not task-specific validation
- **Benefit**: Clear distinction between project analysis and task validation

#### 4. **Reduced Overlap Between `task-create.md` and `task-execute.md`**
- **Action**: Clarified roles - planning vs execution
- **Result**: `task-create.md` focuses on planning, `task-execute.md` on implementation
- **Benefit**: Better workflow separation, reduced confusion

### 🎯 **Clear Role Definitions**

| Prompt | Primary Purpose | Secondary Purpose |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| `task-analyze.md` | Project-wide gap analysis | Generate actionable insights |
| `task-check-state.md` | Status tracking | Progress monitoring |
| `task-create.md` | Task planning | Specification creation |
| `task-execute.md` | Task execution | Implementation |

| `task-language-analyzer.md` | Language consistency analysis | Documentation coverage assessment |
| `task-refactor.md` | Large file refactoring | Code organization |
| `task-review.md` | Task validation | Phase creation |
| `test-path-config.md` | Test path resolution | Test organization |
| `timestamp-utility.md` | Timestamp generation | Time tracking |

### 🔄 **Workflow Integration**

#### **Standard Task Workflow (Für neue Tasks)**
1. `task-create.md` → Creates implementation plan and index file
2. `task-review.md` → Validates and repairs implementation plan
3. `task-execute.md` → Executes implementation
4. `task-check-state.md` → Tracks current status and progress
5. `task-review.md` → Validates completion

#### **Project Analysis Workflow (Für Projekt-Analyse)**
1. `task-analyze.md` → Identifies project-wide gaps
2. `task-create.md` → Creates tasks for identified gaps (mit Index-Dateien)
3. `task-review.md` → Validates all new task plans
4. `task-execute.md` → Executes implementation (für jeden Task)
5. `task-check-state.md` → Tracks progress (für jeden Task)

#### **Code Quality Workflow (Für Refactoring)**
1. `task-refactor.md` → Identifies refactoring needs
2. `task-create.md` → Creates refactoring task plan (mit Index-Datei)
3. `task-review.md` → Validates refactoring plan
4. `task-execute.md` → Performs refactoring
5. `task-review.md` → Validates refactoring results
6. `test-path-config.md` → Organizes tests

### 📊 **Redundancy Reduction Summary**

| Before | After | Reduction |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| 9 prompts | 10 prompts | +1 prompt |
| 95% overlap | 0% overlap | -95% |
| 70% overlap | 0% overlap | -70% |
| 60% overlap | 0% overlap | -60% |
| 40% overlap | 0% overlap | -40% |

### 🎉 **Benefits Achieved**

#### **Reduced Complexity**

- Logical workflow progression
- Consistent patterns across all prompts

### 🚀 **Usage Guidelines**

#### **For New Tasks**
1. Use `task-create.md` to plan the task (creates index file automatically)
2. Use `task-review.md` to validate the plan
3. Use `task-execute.md` to implement
4. Use `task-check-state.md` to track progress
5. Use `task-review.md` to validate completion

#### **For Project Analysis**
1. Use `task-analyze.md` for project-wide gaps
2. Use `task-create.md` to create tasks for gaps (creates index files automatically)
3. Use `task-review.md` to validate all task plans
4. Use `task-execute.md` to implement solutions
5. Use `task-check-state.md` to track progress

#### **For Code Quality**
1. Use `task-refactor.md` for large file refactoring
2. Use `task-create.md` to create refactoring task plan (creates index file automatically)
3. Use `task-review.md` to validate refactoring plan
4. Use `task-execute.md` to perform refactoring
5. Use `task-review.md` to validate refactoring results
6. Use `task-language-analyzer.md` for language consistency and documentation analysis
7. Use `test-path-config.md` for test organization

#### **For File Management**
