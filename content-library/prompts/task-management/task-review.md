# Prompt: Task Review & Validation System

## Goal
Review, validate, and improve development tasks against the actual codebase. Analyze implementation files, verify code existence, identify gaps, and enhance task documentation with real-world findings.

## Core Review Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis
- [ ] Scan entire project structure for current state
- [ ] Identify existing files, components, and services
- [ ] Map current architecture patterns and conventions
- [ ] Document actual tech stack and dependencies
- [ ] Analyze existing code quality and patterns

### Phase 2: Implementation File Validation
- [ ] Read existing implementation file
- [ ] Cross-reference planned files with actual codebase
- [ ] Verify file paths and directory structures
- [ ] Check for naming convention consistency
- [ ] Validate technical requirements against reality

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis
- [ ] Identify missing files from implementation plan
- [ ] Detect incomplete implementations
- [ ] Find broken dependencies or imports
- [ ] Locate outdated or incorrect file references
- [ ] Spot architectural inconsistencies

### Phase 4: Code Quality Assessment
- [ ] Review existing code for best practices
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Analyze performance implications
- [ ] Verify error handling patterns
- [ ] Assess test coverage and quality

### Phase 5: Implementation File Enhancement
- [ ] Update file paths to match actual structure
- [ ] Add missing dependencies and imports
- [ ] Correct technical specifications
- [ ] Enhance implementation details
- [ ] Add real-world constraints and considerations

## Validation Rules

### File Existence Validation
- **Required**: All planned files must exist or be clearly marked for creation
- **Path Accuracy**: File paths must match actual project structure
- **Naming Consistency**: Follow established project naming conventions
- **Import Validation**: All imports must resolve to existing files
- **Dependency Check**: All dependencies must be available in package.json

### Code Quality Validation
- **Syntax Check**: All code must be syntactically correct
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established architectural patterns
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling throughout
- **Security**: Validate input/output and authentication
- **Performance**: Check for performance bottlenecks

### Integration Validation
- **API Endpoints**: Verify all endpoints are properly connected
- **Database**: Ensure schema matches implementation
- **Frontend-Backend**: Validate data flow between layers
- **Event System**: Check event handling and messaging
- **WebSocket**: Verify real-time communication setup

## Review Output Format

### Implementation File Updates
```markdown
## Validation Results - [Date]

### ‚úÖ Completed Items
- [x] File: `path/to/file.js` - Status: Implemented correctly
- [x] Feature: User authentication - Status: Working as expected

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found
- [ ] File: `path/to/missing.js` - Status: Not found, needs creation
- [ ] Import: `./utils/helper` - Status: File doesn't exist
- [ ] API: `/api/users` - Status: Endpoint not implemented

### üîß Improvements Made
- Updated file path from `src/components/` to `frontend/src/components/`
- Added missing dependency: `express-validator`
- Corrected import statement: `import { AuthService } from '../services/AuthService'`

### üìä Code Quality Metrics
- **Coverage**: 85% (needs improvement)
- **Security Issues**: 2 medium, 1 low
- **Performance**: Good (response time < 200ms)
- **Maintainability**: Excellent (clean code patterns)

### üöÄ Next Steps
1. Create missing files: `backend/services/EmailService.js`
2. Fix security vulnerabilities in `AuthController.js`
3. Add integration tests for user registration
4. Update API documentation
```

### Gap Analysis Report
```markdown
## Gap Analysis - [Feature Name]

### Missing Components
1. **Backend Services**
   - EmailService (planned but not implemented)
   - PasswordResetService (referenced but missing)

2. **Frontend Components**
   - PasswordResetForm (planned but not created)
   - UserProfile (incomplete implementation)

3. **Database**
   - password_reset_tokens table (referenced in code but not in schema)

4. **API Endpoints**
   - POST /api/auth/reset-password (planned but not implemented)
   - GET /api/users/profile (incomplete)

### Incomplete Implementations
1. **User Registration**
   - Missing email verification
   - No password strength validation
   - Incomplete error handling

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - JWT refresh token not implemented
   - Session management incomplete
   - Logout functionality missing

### Broken Dependencies
1. **Import Errors**
   - `../utils/validation` (file doesn't exist)
   - `../../config/database` (wrong path)

2. **Missing Packages**
   - `bcryptjs` (used but not in package.json)
   - `jsonwebtoken` (version mismatch)
```

## Automated Validation Commands

### File System Validation
```bash
# Check file existence
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | grep -E "(AuthService|UserController)"

# Validate imports
grep -r "import.*from" src/ | grep -v "node_modules"

# Check package dependencies
npm list --depth=0
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Check security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Performance analysis
npm run build -- --analyze
```

### Database Validation
```bash
# Check schema consistency
psql -d database_name -c "\dt"

# Validate migrations
npm run migrate:status

# Check data integrity
npm run db:validate
```

## Implementation File Enhancement Process

### 1. Update File Structure
- Correct all file paths to match actual project structure
- Add missing directories and files
- Remove references to non-existent files
- Update import statements with correct paths

### 2. Enhance Technical Details
- Add actual code examples from existing files
- Include real configuration values
- Document actual API responses
- Add error handling patterns from codebase

### 3. Improve Implementation Steps
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Add validation checkpoints
- Include rollback procedures
- Add troubleshooting guides

### 4. Update Dependencies
- List actual package versions used
- Include peer dependencies
- Document environment requirements
- Add build and deployment scripts
