# Prompt: Complete Automated Task Execution

## Goal
Execute complete development tasks automatically with phase-by-phase implementation, automatic file creation/modification, and full task completion without requiring user input or confirmation.

**Note**: Tasks are automatically organized in hierarchical folder structure: `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/`

## Core Principles
- **Zero User Input Required**: Execute all phases automatically
- **Complete Implementation**: Create/modify all necessary files
- **Phase-by-Phase Execution**: Follow structured implementation approach
- **Automatic Updates**: Update implementation files and documentation

## File Management Rules

### Automatic File Creation
- Create all new files with proper structure and content
- Follow project naming conventions and patterns
- Include all necessary imports and dependencies
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Implement complete functionality, not stubs
- **Organize files in hierarchical structure**: `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/`
- **Create main implementation file**: `[name]-implementation.md`
- **Create phase files**: `[name]-phase-[number].md` for subtasks

### Automatic File Modification
- Update existing files with new functionality
- Maintain existing code structure and patterns
- Preserve existing functionality while adding features
- Update imports and dependencies as needed
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Implementation File Updates
- Create/update `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/[name]-implementation.md`
- Create/update phase files: `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/[name]-phase-[number].md`
- Track progress through all phases
- Document all changes and decisions
- Update completion status automatically
- Include technical details and implementation notes

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Phase Failure Recovery
- If a phase fails, analyze the error and retry
- Implement alternative approaches if primary method fails
- Continue with subsequent phases when possible
- Document failures and recovery actions
- Maintain system stability throughout execution

### Validation & Quality Assurance
- Validate each file creation/modification
- Ensure code compiles and runs correctly
- Verify integration points work properly
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Confirm performance requirements are met

## File Management Rules

### Automatic File Creation
- Create all new files with proper structure and content
- Follow project naming conventions and patterns
- Include all necessary imports and dependencies
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Implement complete functionality, not stubs
- **Organize files in hierarchical structure**: `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/`
- **Create main implementation file**: `[name]-implementation.md`
- **Create phase files**: `[name]-phase-[number].md` for subtasks

### Automatic File Modification
- Update existing files with new functionality
- Maintain existing code structure and patterns
- Preserve existing functionality while adding features
- Update imports and dependencies as needed
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Implementation File Updates
- Create/update `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/[name]-implementation.md`
- Create/update phase files: `docs/09_roadmap/features/[category]/[name]/[name]-phase-[number].md`
- Track progress through all phases
- Document all changes and decisions
- Update completion status automatically
- Include technical details and implementation notes

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Phase Failure Recovery
- If a phase fails, analyze the error and retry
- Implement alternative approaches if primary method fails
- Continue with subsequent phases when possible
- Document failures and recovery actions
- Maintain system stability throughout execution

### Validation & Quality Assurance
- Validate each file creation/modification
- Ensure code compiles and runs correctly
- Verify integration points work properly
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Confirm performance requirements are met
