# Output Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing generated artifacts and results from the CursorWeb Development Task Management Suite. It serves as a centralized location for outputs produced by automated tasks, AI analysis, script execution, and project documentation.

## Directory Structure

- **tasks/**: Contains reports and logs related to task execution, including status updates, results, and error logs.
- **analysis/**: Stores AI-powered project analysis results, such as code quality assessments, performance profiling, and security scans.
- **scripts/**: Holds automatically generated scripts for build, deployment, testing, and other automation tasks.
- **documentation/**: Includes generated markdown files and documentation for projects, tasks, and system usage.
- **logs/**: General system logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Usage

- Outputs are automatically generated by the Task Management Suite and stored in the respective subdirectories.
- Users can review these outputs via the web interface or directly access files for detailed insights.
- Ensure that this directory is not used for manual file storage to maintain the integrity of automated outputs.

## Maintenance

- Periodically review and archive old outputs to manage disk space.
- Use system tools or scripts to clean up obsolete files or logs as needed.
