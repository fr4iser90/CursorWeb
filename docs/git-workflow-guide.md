# Git Workflow Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the Git management system in PIDEA to handle your Git workflow, from feature branch creation to merging changes back to main.

## Git Workflow Steps

### 1. Feature Branch Creation ‚úÖ (Already Done)

Your refactoring system has already created a new branch for your changes. This is the correct approach!

### 2. Using the Git Management Interface

Navigate to the **üîß Git** tab in the main navigation to access the Git management interface.

#### Available Buttons:

- **‚úÖ Validate** - Check your current changes for potential issues
- **üîç Compare** - View differences between your branch and main
- **‚¨áÔ∏è Pull** - Get latest changes from main branch
- **üîÄ Merge** - Merge your changes into main branch

### 3. Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Step 1: Validate Your Changes
1. Click the **‚úÖ Validate** button
2. Review any warnings or suggestions
3. Ensure your changes are ready for integration

#### Step 2: Compare with Main
1. Click the **üîç Compare** button
2. Review the diff modal showing changes between your branch and main
3. Verify that all changes are intentional and correct

#### Step 3: Pull Latest Changes (Optional)
1. Click the **‚¨áÔ∏è Pull** button to get any updates from main
2. This ensures you're merging with the latest version
3. Resolve any conflicts if they occur

#### Step 4: Merge to Main
1. Click the **üîÄ Merge** button
2. Confirm the merge operation
3. Your changes will be integrated into the main branch

## Git Status Display

The interface shows:
- **Current branch** you're working on
- **File status** (modified, added, deleted)
- **Branch selector** to switch between branches
- **Real-time updates** of Git operations

## Branch Management

### Switching Branches
- Use the branch selector dropdown to switch between branches
- The current branch is marked with a üìç icon

### Creating New Branches
- Use the **Create Branch** functionality in the Git interface
- Branches are created safely with proper validation

## Safety Features

The Git management system includes several safety features:

1. **User Permissions** - Only authorized users can perform Git operations
2. **Command Validation** - Dangerous Git commands are blocked
3. **Conflict Detection** - Automatic detection of merge conflicts
4. **Rollback Capability** - Ability to undo operations if needed
5. **Audit Logging** - All Git operations are logged for security

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Development
```
1. Create feature branch ‚úÖ (Already done)
2. Make changes ‚úÖ (Your refactoring)
3. Validate changes ‚úÖ (Use Validate button)
4. Compare with main ‚úÖ (Use Compare button)
5. Merge to main ‚úÖ (Use Merge button)
```

### Scenario 2: Updating from Main
```
1. Switch to main branch
2. Pull latest changes
3. Switch back to feature branch
4. Merge main into feature branch
5. Continue development
```

### Scenario 3: Conflict Resolution
```
1. Attempt merge
2. System detects conflicts
3. Review conflict markers
4. Resolve conflicts manually
5. Complete merge
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate** before merging
2. **Compare changes** to understand what you're merging
3. **Pull latest changes** before merging to avoid conflicts
4. **Use descriptive branch names** for better organization
5. **Commit frequently** with meaningful messages
6. **Test after merging** to ensure everything works

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Not a Git repository"
- **Solution**: Ensure you're in a directory with a `.git` folder

**Issue**: "Permission denied"
- **Solution**: Check your user permissions for Git operations

**Issue**: "Merge conflicts"
- **Solution**: Resolve conflicts manually in your IDE, then complete the merge

**Issue**: "Branch not found"
- **Solution**: Ensure the branch exists and you have access to it

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the operation result messages in the interface
2. Review the browser console for detailed error information
3. Contact your system administrator for permission issues

## API Endpoints

The Git management system provides these API endpoints:

- `POST /api/git/status` - Get Git status
- `POST /api/git/branches` - Get all branches
- `POST /api/git/validate` - Validate changes
- `POST /api/git/compare` - Compare branches
- `POST /api/git/pull` - Pull changes
- `POST /api/git/checkout` - Switch branches
- `POST /api/git/merge` - Merge branches
- `POST /api/git/create-branch` - Create new branch
- `POST /api/git/info` - Get repository info

## Security Considerations

- All Git operations require authentication
- Dangerous commands are automatically blocked
- User permissions are validated for each operation
- All operations are logged for audit purposes
- Repository access is restricted to authorized users

## Integration with IDE

The Git management system integrates with your IDE:
- Real-time status updates
- Automatic branch detection
- Seamless workflow between IDE and web interface
- Terminal automation for Git operations

## Next Steps

Now that you have the Git management system set up:

1. **Navigate to the Git tab** in the main interface
2. **Validate your current changes** using the Validate button
3. **Compare your branch with main** to review changes
4. **Merge your changes** when ready

Your refactoring work is already on a feature branch, so you're ready to proceed with the validation and merge process!
