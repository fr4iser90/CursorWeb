- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging, different levels for operations
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 95% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Parallel execution isolation and security
- [ ] Resource allocation limits and controls
- [ ] Workflow execution validation and sanitization
- [ ] Event handling security
- [ ] Cache security and data protection
- [ ] Protection against resource exhaustion attacks

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 500ms for workflow execution start
- **Throughput**: 2000+ parallel workflows per minute
- **Memory Usage**: < 200MB for parallel execution engine
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with caching and indexing
- **Caching Strategy**: Workflow metadata caching, execution result caching
