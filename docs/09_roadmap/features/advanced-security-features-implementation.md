## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with existing project rules, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for files
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging, different levels for operations
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Input validation for security scanning
- [ ] Secure storage of security data
- [ ] Rate limiting for security operations
- [ ] Audit logging for all security actions
