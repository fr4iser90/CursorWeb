- [ ] Add environment management (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Add backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Implement health checks and readiness probes
- [ ] Add deployment automation and rollback
- [ ] Implement logging aggregation

#### Phase 3: Integration (15 hours)
- [ ] Integrate with existing application infrastructure
- [ ] Connect deployment to all services
- [ ] Implement real-time deployment monitoring
- [ ] Add deployment validation gates
- [ ] Integrate with existing logging system
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard integration

#### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (8 hours)
- [ ] Write unit tests for all deployment components
- [ ] Write integration tests for deployment API
- [ ] Create E2E tests for complete deployment workflow
- [ ] Update documentation with deployment features
- [ ] Create deployment and operations guide

#### Phase 5: Deployment & Validation (2 hours)
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Perform deployment system validation
- [ ] Validate monitoring and backup functionality
- [ ] Deploy to production with monitoring

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with existing project rules, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for files
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging, different levels for operations
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Secure container configurations
- [ ] Environment variable management
