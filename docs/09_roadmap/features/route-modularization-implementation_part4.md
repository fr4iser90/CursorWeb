## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Advanced Route Modules (1 hour)
- [ ] Implement terminal logs routes (7 routes)
- [ ] Implement IDE mirror streaming routes (6 routes)
- [ ] Create advanced validation middleware
- [ ] Test advanced route functionality

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (0.5 hours)
- [ ] Write unit tests for all route modules
- [ ] Write integration tests for route functionality
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for complete flows
- [ ] Validate all route endpoints functionality

### Phase 3: Final Integration & Documentation (0.5 hours)
- [ ] Update main route registry with all modules
- [ ] Final testing of complete route system
- [ ] Update documentation and README
- [ ] Performance validation and optimization

## 5. Route Bundles Included

### BUNDLE 14: Terminal Logs (7 routes)
```javascript
// terminal-logs.routes.js
- /api/terminal-logs/:port/initialize (POST)
- /api/terminal-logs/:port/execute (POST)
- /api/terminal-logs/:port (GET)
- /api/terminal-logs/:port/search (GET)
- /api/terminal-logs/:port/export (GET)
- /api/terminal-logs/:port (DELETE)
- /api/terminal-logs/:port/capture-status (GET)
```

### BUNDLE 15: IDE Mirror Streaming (6 routes)
```javascript
// ide-mirror.routes.js
- /api/ide-mirror/:port/stream/start (POST)
- /api/ide-mirror/:port/stream/stop (POST)
- /api/ide-mirror/:port/stream/status (GET)
- /api/ide-mirror/:port/stream/config (PUT)
- /api/ide-mirror/:port/stream/pause (POST)
- /api/ide-mirror/:port/stream/resume (POST)
```

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/routes/RouteModules.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Route registration, middleware integration, error handling
- [ ] Mock requirements: Express app, controllers, middleware

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/routes/RouteIntegration.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Full route request/response cycles, authentication flow
- [ ] Test data: Mock user sessions, project data, authentication tokens

### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/e2e/routes/RouteE2E.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Complete API endpoint testing, authentication flows
- [ ] Browser compatibility: API testing doesn't require browser compatibility

## 7. Success Criteria
- [ ] All advanced route modules work identically to current implementation
- [ ] Terminal logs routes function properly with port validation
- [ ] IDE mirror streaming routes function properly with port validation
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] All end-to-end tests pass
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Code is more maintainable and organized
- [ ] Complete route modularization is functional

## 8. Final Integration Checklist
- [ ] All 18 route bundles are implemented
- [ ] All 250+ routes are functional
- [ ] Route registry system is complete
- [ ] All middleware is properly integrated
- [ ] Authentication and authorization work correctly
- [ ] Port validation works on all port-based routes
- [ ] Project validation works on all project-based routes
- [ ] Error handling is consistent across all modules
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## 10. Complete Route Modularization Summary

### Total Implementation:
- **4 Parts**: Foundation, IDE Management, Project-Based, Advanced Routes
- **18 Route Bundles**: All route categories modularized
- **250+ Routes**: Complete route system refactored
- **16 Hours Total**: Properly distributed across 4 manageable parts
- **0 Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved

### Architecture Benefits:
- **Modularity**: Each route bundle is independently maintainable
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new route modules
- **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: No degradation, potential improvements

### Dependencies Flow:
```
Part 1 (Foundation) → Part 2 (IDE Management) → Part 3 (Project-Based) → Part 4 (Advanced)
     ↓                      ↓                        ↓                      ↓
