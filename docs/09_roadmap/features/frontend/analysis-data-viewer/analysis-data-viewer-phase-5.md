}
```

### Monitoring Setup
```javascript
// Monitoring configuration
const monitoringConfig = {
  analysis: {
    metrics: ['response_time', 'error_rate', 'data_volume'],
    alerts: {
      response_time_threshold: 500,
      error_rate_threshold: 0.05,
      data_volume_threshold: 1000
    }
  }
};
```
