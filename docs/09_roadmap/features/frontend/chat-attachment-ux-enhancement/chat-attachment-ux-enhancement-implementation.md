- **Dependencies**: Existing chat message system, Markdown renderer (marked), file upload infrastructure
- **Related Issues**: Enhancement of current file upload functionality in ChatComponent

## 2. Technical Requirements
- **Tech Stack**: React, JavaScript, CSS, marked (already available via CDN), File API
- **Architecture Pattern**: Component-based React with hooks
- **Database Changes**: None (attachments stored in message metadata)
- **API Changes**: None (file handling remains client-side)
- **Frontend Changes**: Chat UI enhancement, attachment display, Markdown preview modal
- **Backend Changes**: None

## 3. File Impact Analysis

### Files to Modify:
- [ ] `frontend/src/presentation/components/chat/main/ChatComponent.jsx` - Add attachment state management, multiple file support, attachment rendering
- [ ] `frontend/src/domain/entities/ChatMessage.jsx` - Add attachment metadata support
- [ ] `frontend/src/css/main/chat.css` - Add styles for attachment icons, preview modal, and attachment display

### Files to Create:
- [ ] `frontend/src/presentation/components/chat/main/MarkdownAttachmentIcon.jsx` - Reusable component for displaying Markdown file icons with filenames
- [ ] `frontend/src/presentation/components/chat/main/MarkdownPreviewModal.jsx` - Modal component for rendering Markdown content
- [ ] `frontend/src/css/components/attachment-icon.css` - Styles for attachment icons and interactions
- [ ] `frontend/src/css/components/markdown-preview-modal.css` - Styles for the Markdown preview modal

## 4. Implementation Phases

- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, user-friendly error messages
- **Logging**: Console logging for development, structured error logging
- **Testing**: Jest framework with React Testing Library
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate file types and sizes on upload (max 10MB per file)
- [ ] Prevent XSS in Markdown rendering (sanitize input)
- [ ] No sensitive data in attachments
- [ ] File type whitelist for security
- [ ] Client-side file validation before upload

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <100ms for UI updates, <500ms for file processing
- **Throughput**: Support up to 10 files per message
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB for file processing
- **Database Queries**: N/A (client-side storage)
- **Caching Strategy**: File content cached in memory during session

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/MarkdownAttachmentIcon.test.jsx`
- [ ] Test cases: File type detection, icon rendering, click handlers
- [ ] Mock requirements: File objects, DOM events

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/ChatComponent.test.jsx`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Multiple file uploads, attachment display, preview modal
- [ ] Test data: Sample Markdown files, various file types

### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/e2e/chat-attachments.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Upload files, view attachments, preview Markdown
- [ ] Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## 9. Documentation Requirements

## 10. Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment:
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Security validation passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Deployment:
- [ ] No database migrations required

- [ ] Static assets deployed
- [ ] CDN cache cleared if applicable

### Post-deployment:
- [ ] Monitor for file upload errors
- [ ] Verify attachment functionality in production
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] User feedback collection enabled

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Revert to previous ChatComponent version if issues arise
- [ ] Remove new CSS files if styling conflicts occur
- [ ] Disable attachment features via feature flag if needed
- [ ] Communication plan for users if rollback required

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Markdown files display as icons with filenames in chat messages
- [ ] Multiple attachments supported per message (up to 10 files)
- [ ] Clicking attachment icon opens Markdown preview modal
- [ ] No full content shown by default in chat bubbles
- [ ] All existing chat functionality preserved
- [ ] File upload works with existing file input
- [ ] Attachments persist in chat history
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% coverage

## 13. Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- [ ] File size limits causing browser crashes - Mitigation: Implement file size validation and chunked processing
- [ ] Memory leaks from large file handling - Mitigation: Proper cleanup and memory management

### Medium Risk:
- [ ] Markdown rendering conflicts with existing chat - Mitigation: Isolated preview modal, careful CSS scoping
- [ ] Browser compatibility issues - Mitigation: Test across major browsers, provide fallbacks

### Low Risk:
- [ ] UI/UX bugs in attachment display - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, can be fixed quickly
- [ ] Performance impact on chat scrolling - Mitigation: Optimized rendering, lazy loading for large chat histories

## Database Task Creation Instructions

This markdown will be parsed into a database task with the following mapping:

```sql
INSERT INTO tasks (
  id, project_id, title, description, type, category, priority, status,
  source_type, source_path, source_content, metadata, estimated_hours
) VALUES (
  uuid(), -- Generated
  '[project_id]', -- From context
  'Chat Attachment UX Enhancement', -- From section 1
  '[Full markdown content]', -- Complete description
  'feature', -- Derived from Technical Requirements
  'frontend', -- From section 1 Category field
  'high', -- From section 1
  'pending', -- Initial status
  'markdown_doc', -- Source type
  'docs/09_roadmap/features/frontend/chat-attachment-ux-enhancement/chat-attachment-ux-enhancement-implementation.md', -- Main implementation file
  '[Full markdown content]', -- For reference
  '[JSON with all metadata]', -- All technical details
  12 -- From section 1 Estimated Time in hours
);
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Fill in all sections completely** - Every field maps to database columns
2. **Be specific with file paths** - Enables precise file tracking
3. **Include exact time estimates** - Critical for project planning
4. **Specify AI execution requirements** - Automation level, confirmation needs
5. **List all dependencies** - Enables proper task sequencing
6. **Include success criteria** - Enables automatic completion detection
7. **Provide detailed phases** - Enables progress tracking
8. **Set correct category** - Automatically organizes tasks into category folders
9. **Use category-specific paths** - Tasks are automatically placed in correct folders

## Automatic Category Organization

When you specify a **Category** in section 1, the system automatically:

1. **Creates category folder** if it doesn't exist: `docs/09_roadmap/features/frontend/`
2. **Creates task folder** for each task: `docs/09_roadmap/features/frontend/chat-attachment-ux-enhancement/`
3. **Places main implementation file**: `docs/09_roadmap/features/frontend/chat-attachment-ux-enhancement/chat-attachment-ux-enhancement-implementation.md`
4. **Sets database category** field to the specified category
5. **Organizes tasks hierarchically** for better management
