# Task Creation Modal â€“ Phase 3A: Frontend Services & Components

## Overview
Create the frontend services and components for AI workflow integration, including TaskCreationService, TaskWorkflowRepository, and TaskWorkflowProgress components.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create TaskCreationService for workflow orchestration
- [ ] Create TaskWorkflowRepository for API communication
- [ ] Create TaskWorkflowProgress component for real-time tracking
- [ ] Create task-workflow-progress.css styling
- [ ] Integrate with existing event bus system
- [ ] Test frontend components independently

## Deliverables
- File: `frontend/src/application/services/TaskCreationService.jsx` - Workflow orchestration service
- File: `frontend/src/infrastructure/repositories/TaskWorkflowRepository.jsx` - API communication layer
- File: `frontend/src/presentation/components/chat/modal/TaskWorkflowProgress.jsx` - Progress tracking component
- File: `frontend/src/css/modal/task-workflow-progress.css` - Progress component styling
- Integration: Event bus communication with existing system
- Test: Frontend component unit tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (modal foundation)
- Requires: Phase 2 completion (form components)
- Blocks: Phase 3B start (backend API integration)

## Estimated Time
4 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] TaskCreationService properly orchestrates workflow
- [ ] TaskWorkflowRepository communicates with existing APIs
- [ ] TaskWorkflowProgress displays real-time updates
- [ ] Event bus integration works correctly
- [ ] Progress component shows all states
- [ ] Styling matches existing modal patterns
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Components are independently testable

## Implementation Details

### TaskCreationService Features
- AI prompt generation for task creation
- IDE chat message sending via APIChatRepository
- Auto-finish workflow initiation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Workflow cancellation support
- Event bus integration for progress updates

### TaskWorkflowRepository Features
- Auto-finish workflow API communication
- Workflow status monitoring
- Workflow cancellation
- Error handling and logging
- Integration with existing project-based API patterns

### TaskWorkflowProgress Features
- Real-time progress bar with status indicators
- Workflow logs with timestamp and level
- Error display and recovery options
- Result summary display
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Event bus integration for updates

### CSS Styling Features
- Consistent with existing modal styling patterns
- Dark theme matching application design
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Status-based color coding
- Accessible design patterns

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for TaskCreationService methods
- Integration tests for TaskWorkflowRepository API calls
- Component tests for TaskWorkflowProgress rendering
- Event bus communication tests
- Responsive design tests
- Error handling tests

## Risk Mitigation
- Use existing API patterns to minimize integration issues
- Follow established event bus patterns for consistency
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- Test components independently before integration
- Use existing styling patterns for consistency
