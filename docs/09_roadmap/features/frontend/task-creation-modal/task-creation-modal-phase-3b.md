# Task Creation Modal â€“ Phase 3B: Backend API Integration

## Overview
Implement backend API endpoints and integration for auto-finish workflow orchestration, connecting the frontend components with the existing AutoFinishSystem and WorkflowOrchestrationService.

## Objectives
- [ ] Enhance existing workflow endpoints for auto-finish integration
- [ ] Implement auto-finish workflow processing endpoints
- [ ] Add workflow status monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Integrate with existing AutoFinishSystem
- [ ] Add workflow cancellation support
- [ ] Test backend API integration

## Deliverables
- API: `/api/projects/${projectId}/workflow/execute` - Enhanced for auto-finish workflow
- API: `/api/workflow/stop` - Enhanced for workflow cancellation
- API: `/api/workflow/status` - Enhanced for workflow status monitoring
- Integration: AutoFinishSystem.processTodoList() integration
- Integration: WorkflowOrchestrationService integration
- Test: Backend API integration tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 3A completion (frontend services & components)
- Requires: Existing AutoFinishSystem functionality
- Requires: Existing WorkflowOrchestrationService
- Blocks: Phase 4 start (integration testing)

## Estimated Time
4 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Auto-finish workflow endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Workflow status monitoring functions properly
- [ ] Workflow cancellation works as expected
- [ ] Integration with AutoFinishSystem is seamless
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] API responses are consistent
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] All endpoints are properly tested

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Workflow Execute Endpoint

**Features**:
- Accept auto-finish workflow requests
- Process todoInput with AutoFinishSystem
- Return workflow status and progress
- Support workflow options and configuration
- Handle project-based routing

### Enhanced Workflow Stop Endpoint
**Route**: `POST /api/workflow/stop`
**Features**:
- Cancel running workflows by ID
- Clean up workflow resources
- Update workflow status
- Return cancellation confirmation
- Handle multiple workflow types

### Enhanced Workflow Status Endpoint
**Route**: `GET /api/workflow/status`
**Features**:
- Get workflow status by ID
- Return progress information
- Include workflow logs
- Support real-time status updates
- Handle workflow history

### AutoFinishSystem Integration
- Use existing AutoFinishSystem.processTodoList() method
- Integrate with existing session management
- Support workflow options and configuration
- Handle confirmation loops and fallback detection
- Maintain existing error handling patterns

### WorkflowOrchestrationService Integration
- Use existing WorkflowOrchestrationService patterns
- Support enhanced git workflow integration
- Maintain existing execution engine patterns
- Handle workflow type routing
- Support sequential execution

## API Specifications

### Workflow Execute Request
```json
{
  "todoInput": "TODO: Implement user registration form",
  "options": {
    "workflowId": "task-creation-1234567890",
    "taskData": {
      "description": "Implement user registration form",
      "category": "feature",
      "priority": "medium",
      "type": "feature",
      "estimatedHours": 4
    },
    "workflowType": "auto-finish",
    "maxConfirmationAttempts": 3,
    "confirmationTimeout": 10000,
    "fallbackDetectionEnabled": true,
    "autoContinueThreshold": 0.8
  }
}
```

### Workflow Execute Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "workflowId": "task-creation-1234567890",
  "status": "started",
  "sessionId": "session-1234567890",
  "message": "Auto-finish workflow started successfully",
  "data": {
    "totalTasks": 1,
    "completedTasks": 0,
    "progress": 0
  }
}
```

### Workflow Status Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "workflowId": "task-creation-1234567890",
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": 45,
  "currentStep": "Executing task implementation",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "session-1234567890",
    "totalTasks": 1,
    "completedTasks": 0,
    "logs": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2024-12-19T10:30:00.000Z",
        "level": "info",
        "message": "Starting auto-finish workflow"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for workflow execute endpoint
- Unit tests for workflow status monitoring
- End-to-end tests for workflow cancellation
- Performance tests for concurrent workflows
- Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
- API response format validation tests

## Error Handling
- Handle AutoFinishSystem failures gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Support workflow recovery mechanisms
- Log errors for debugging
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

## Performance Considerations
- Support concurrent workflow execution
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Monitor workflow execution time
- Handle large todoInput efficiently
- Optimize status polling frequency

## Security Considerations
- Validate project access permissions
- Sanitize todoInput content
- Rate limit workflow execution
- Log security-relevant events
- Validate workflow options

## Risk Mitigation
- Use existing AutoFinishSystem patterns to minimize integration issues
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Test with various input scenarios
- Monitor performance and resource usage
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints
