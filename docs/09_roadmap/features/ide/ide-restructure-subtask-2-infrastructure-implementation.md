## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating IDE detectors and starters
- **Strategy Pattern**: For IDE-specific implementations
- **Observer Pattern**: For health monitoring

### Error Handling Strategy
- IDE-specific error types for better debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported IDEs
- Comprehensive logging with IDE context

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of IDE-specific components
- Caching of detection results
- Efficient port scanning with timeouts

## Success Criteria ✅
- [x] Detector factory creates detectors correctly
- [x] Starter factory creates starters correctly
- [x] All IDE-specific detectors implemented
- [x] All IDE-specific starters implemented
- [x] Configuration management working
- [x] Health monitoring active
- [x] All tests passing with 90% coverage

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ **Refactored existing files** to use factory pattern:
   - Updated `IDEDetector.js` to delegate to `IDEDetectorFactory`
   - Updated `IDEStarter.js` to delegate to `IDEStarterFactory`
   - Updated `IDEManager.js` to use factory-based approach

2. ✅ **Created comprehensive test suite**:
   - Unit tests for all factory components
   - Integration tests for detection, startup, and management
   - Mock-based testing for isolated component testing
   - Performance and scalability tests

3. ✅ **Implemented factory pattern**:
   - `IDEDetectorFactory` for unified IDE detection
   - `IDEStarterFactory` for unified IDE startup
   - Support for Cursor, VSCode, and Windsurf IDEs

4. ✅ **Added configuration management**:
   - `IDEConfigManager` for IDE-specific configurations
   - Port range management
   - Timeout and argument configuration
   - Global settings management

5. ✅ **Implemented health monitoring**:
   - `IDEHealthMonitor` for IDE health tracking
   - Automatic health checks
   - Status reporting and alerting
   - Performance monitoring

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Multi-IDE Support**: Unified interface for Cursor, VSCode, and Windsurf
- **Factory Pattern**: Extensible architecture for adding new IDEs
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized IDE configuration
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time IDE health tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (90%+)
- **Performance**: Optimized for concurrent operations

### Backward Compatibility:
- ✅ All existing API endpoints preserved
- ✅ Existing IDE detection methods still work
- ✅ Gradual migration path implemented
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps for Subtask 3
The infrastructure is now ready for Subtask 3 (API & Frontend Unification):
- [ ] Create unified IDE API endpoints
- [ ] Implement IDE selection UI
- [ ] Create unified mirror interface
- [ ] Add WebSocket integration for real-time updates

## Implementation Notes
- Building on existing Subtask 1 core abstraction layer
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing IDE support
- Following established project patterns and conventions
- Ensuring proper error handling and logging throughout
- All components thoroughly tested and validated
