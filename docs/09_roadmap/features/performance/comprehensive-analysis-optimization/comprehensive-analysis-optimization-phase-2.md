# Comprehensive Analysis Optimization â€“ Phase 2: Progressive Analysis Implementation

## Overview
Implement progressive analysis with chunking, streaming, and memory management to handle large repositories without OOM crashes. This phase builds on the existing MemoryOptimizedAnalysisService and adds queue integration.

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement ProgressiveAnalysisService with chunking
- [ ] Add memory monitoring and cleanup during analysis
- [ ] Create analysis batching and parallel processing limits
- [ ] Implement analysis result streaming and partial results
- [ ] Integrate with queue system from Phase 1

## Deliverables
- File: `backend/domain/services/ProgressiveAnalysisService.js` - Progressive analysis with chunking
- File: `backend/domain/services/AnalysisMemoryManager.js` - Enhanced memory management
- API: `/api/projects/:projectId/analysis/:type/start` - Individual analysis start endpoints
- API: `/api/projects/:projectId/analysis/:type/status` - Analysis status monitoring
- API: `/api/projects/:projectId/analysis/:type/progress` - Real-time progress updates
- API: `/api/projects/:projectId/analysis/:type/cancel` - Analysis cancellation
- Test: `tests/integration/ProgressiveAnalysis.test.js` - Integration tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (Analysis Queue System)
- Blocks: Phase 3 start (Frontend Integration & Testing)

## Estimated Time
4 hours

## Technical Implementation

### ProgressiveAnalysisService Features
- File chunking (configurable batch sizes)
- Memory usage monitoring and cleanup
- Streaming analysis results
- Partial result delivery
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Integration with existing analysis services

### Individual Analysis Endpoints
```javascript
// Start analysis
POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/code-quality/start
Body: { options: { chunkSize: 100, maxMemory: 256 } }
Response: { jobId: "job-123", status: "queued" }

// Analysis status
GET /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/code-quality/status
Response: { status: "running", progress: 45, memoryUsage: 180 }

// Analysis progress
GET /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/code-quality/progress
Response: { progress: 45, currentFile: "src/components/Button.js", filesProcessed: 450 }

// Cancel analysis
POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/code-quality/cancel
Response: { cancelled: true, message: "Analysis cancelled successfully" }
```

### Memory Management Features
- Real-time memory monitoring
- Automatic garbage collection triggers
- Memory limit enforcement
- Resource cleanup on cancellation
- Memory usage reporting

### Analysis Types Supported
1. Code Quality Analysis
2. Security Analysis  
3. Performance Analysis
4. Architecture Analysis
5. Dependencies Analysis
6. Tech Stack Analysis
7. Documentation Analysis
8. Test Coverage Analysis
