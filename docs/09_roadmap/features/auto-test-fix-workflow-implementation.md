## 4. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Test Report Parsing (2 hours)
- [ ] Create TestReportParser service
- [ ] Implement parsing for test-report-full.md
- [ ] Implement parsing for test-report.md
- [ ] Implement parsing for coverage.md
- [ ] Add unit tests for parser

#### Phase 2: Task Generation Logic (2 hours)
- [ ] Create TestFixTaskGenerator service
- [ ] Implement per-file task creation logic
- [ ] Add task metadata extraction from test reports
- [ ] Implement task prioritization based on error count
- [ ] Add validation for generated tasks

#### Phase 3: IDE Integration (2 hours)
- [ ] Create PlaywrightIDEConnector service
- [ ] Implement task-to-prompt conversion
- [ ] Add WebSocket communication with IDE
- [ ] Implement task status tracking
- [ ] Add error handling for IDE communication

#### Phase 4: Workflow Integration (1 hour)
- [ ] Update AutoTestFixSystem to use new components
- [ ] Replace npm test with npm run test:full
- [ ] Integrate task generation into workflow
- [ ] Add IDE task sending to workflow
- [ ] Update error handling

#### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (1 hour)
- [ ] Write integration tests for complete workflow
- [ ] Test with real test reports
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for test fix workflow

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with existing project rules, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for files
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, proper error logging
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging, different levels for operations
- **Testing**: Jest framework, 90% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, README updates

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- [ ] Sanitize task content before sending to IDE
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for task generation
- [ ] Add authentication for IDE communication
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive test data in tasks
- [ ] Validate markdown content before parsing

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Task generation within 5 seconds
- **Throughput**: Handle 100+ test files simultaneously
- **Memory Usage**: Max 512MB for large test reports
- **Database Queries**: Optimize task creation with batch inserts
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache parsed test reports for 1 hour

## 8. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/unit/services/TestReportParser.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Parse various markdown formats, handle malformed input, extract file paths
- [ ] Mock requirements: Mock file system operations

#### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/integration/AutoTestFixWorkflow.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Complete workflow from test execution to IDE task sending
- [ ] Test data: Sample test reports, mock IDE responses

#### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `tests/e2e/TestFixWorkflow.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: End-to-end test fix workflow with real IDE
- [ ] Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox compatibility for Playwright

## 9. Documentation Requirements

#### Code Documentation:
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all parser methods
- [ ] README updates with workflow description
- [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Architecture diagrams for workflow flow

#### User Documentation:
- [ ] User guide for test fix workflow
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Configuration guide for IDE integration
- [ ] Best practices for test report generation

## 10. Deployment Checklist

#### Pre-deployment:
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

#### Deployment:
- [ ] Database migrations (if applicable)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Configuration updates applied
- [ ] Service restarts if needed
- [ ] Health checks configured

#### Post-deployment:
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Verify functionality in production
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] User feedback collection enabled

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Database rollback script prepared
- [ ] Configuration rollback procedure
- [ ] Service rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Communication plan for stakeholders

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Workflow executes npm run test:full successfully
- [ ] Test reports are parsed correctly
- [ ] Tasks are generated per file with correct metadata
- [ ] Tasks are sent to IDE via Playwright/WebSocket
- [ ] IDE receives and processes tasks correctly
- [ ] Task status is tracked and updated

## 13. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk:
- [ ] IDE communication failure - Mitigation: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Large test reports causing memory issues - Mitigation: Implement streaming parsing and memory limits

#### Medium Risk:
- [ ] Markdown parsing errors - Mitigation: Robust error handling and validation
- [ ] Task generation performance issues - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimization

#### Low Risk:
- [ ] Minor formatting issues in generated tasks - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with various input formats
