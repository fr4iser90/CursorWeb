## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✅
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Status**: Complete

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Analyzed current codebase structure and existing analysis endpoints
- [x] Identified gap between GET endpoints and missing POST functionality
- [x] Documented current state: GET endpoints exist, POST endpoints missing
- [x] Created detailed implementation plan with file-by-file breakdown
- [x] Identified integration points with existing services

**Key Findings:**
- GET `/api/analysis/techstack/:projectId` exists
- GET `/api/analysis/recommendations/:projectId` exists
- POST endpoints for creating analysis missing
- Analysis queue system already in place
- Frontend components need integration updates

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ✅
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: Complete

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Added POST routes in `Application.js`:
  - `POST /api/analysis/techstack`
  - `POST /api/analysis/recommendations`
- [x] Implemented controller methods in `AnalysisController.js`:
  - `createTechstackAnalysis()`
  - `createRecommendationsAnalysis()`
- [x] Updated switch statements in `AnalysisQueueService.js`
- [x] Added analysis configurations in `IndividualAnalysisService.js`
- [x] Added comprehensive unit tests for new controller methods

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// New POST routes added
app.post('/api/analysis/techstack', analysisController.createTechstackAnalysis.bind(analysisController));
app.post('/api/analysis/recommendations', analysisController.createRecommendationsAnalysis.bind(analysisController));

// New controller methods with validation and error handling
async createTechstackAnalysis(req, res) {
  // Validation, service calls, and response handling
}

async createRecommendationsAnalysis(req, res) {
  // Validation, service calls, and response handling
}
```

### Phase 3: Integration & Connectivity ✅
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Status**: Complete

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Updated `parseAnalysisTypes` method to include new types
- [x] Configured timeout settings for techstack (5min) and recommendations (10min)
- [x] Verified analysis step categories in database migrations
- [x] Validated service registry integration
- [x] Ensured proper dependency injection

**Integration Points:**
- Analysis type parsing now includes 'techstack' and 'recommendations'
- Timeout configurations updated in multiple services
- Database schema supports new analysis categories
- Service registry properly resolves new analysis types

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation ✅
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Status**: Complete

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Created comprehensive unit tests for new controller methods
- [x] Developed integration tests covering full workflow
- [x] Updated REST API documentation with new endpoints
- [x] Created detailed implementation documentation
- [x] Added error handling and validation tests

**Testing Coverage:**
- Unit tests for controller methods (success and error cases)
- Integration tests for database and queue processing
- API documentation with request/response examples
- Error handling validation for various scenarios
