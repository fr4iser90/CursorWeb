## Database Task Creation Instructions

This markdown will be parsed into a database task with the following mapping:

```sql
INSERT INTO tasks (
  id, project_id, title, description, type, category, priority, status,
  source_type, source_path, source_content, metadata, estimated_hours
) VALUES (
  uuid(), -- Generated
  'pidea', -- From context
  'Modern Logging System', -- From section 1
  '[Full markdown content]', -- Complete description
  'feature', -- Derived from Technical Requirements
  'backend', -- From section 1 Category field
  'high', -- From section 1
  'pending', -- Initial status
  'markdown_doc', -- Source type
  'docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/modern-logging-system/modern-logging-system-implementation.md', -- Main implementation file
  'docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/modern-logging-system/modern-logging-system-phase-[number].md', -- Individual phase files
  '[Full markdown content]', -- For reference
  '[JSON with all metadata]', -- All technical details
  8 -- From section 1
);
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Fill in all sections completely** - Every field maps to database columns
2. **Be specific with file paths** - Enables precise file tracking
3. **Include exact time estimates** - Critical for project planning
4. **Specify AI execution requirements** - Automation level, confirmation needs
5. **List all dependencies** - Enables proper task sequencing
6. **Include success criteria** - Enables automatic completion detection
7. **Provide detailed phases** - Enables progress tracking
8. **Set correct category** - Automatically organizes tasks into category folders
9. **Use category-specific paths** - Tasks are automatically placed in correct folders

## Automatic Category Organization

When you specify a **Category** in section 1, the system automatically:

1. **Creates category folder** if it doesn't exist: `docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/`
2. **Creates task folder** for each task: `docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/modern-logging-system/`
3. **Places main implementation file**: `docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/modern-logging-system/modern-logging-system-implementation.md`
4. **Creates phase files** for subtasks: `docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/modern-logging-system/modern-logging-system-phase-[number].md`
5. **Sets database category** field to the specified category
6. **Organizes tasks hierarchically** for better management

### Example Folder Structure:
```
docs/09_roadmap/features/backend/
└── modern-logging-system/
    ├── modern-logging-system-implementation.md
    ├── modern-logging-system-phase-1.md
    ├── modern-logging-system-phase-2.md
    ├── modern-logging-system-phase-3.md
    ├── modern-logging-system-phase-4.md
    └── modern-logging-system-phase-5.md
