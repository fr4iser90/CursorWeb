# Phase 1: Core Logging Infrastructure

## Overview
Implement the foundational components of the modern logging system with structured formatting, automatic encryption, and centralized management.

## Duration: 2 hours

## Tasks

### 1. Create LogSanitizer with sensitive data detection
**File**: `backend/infrastructure/logging/LogSanitizer.js`
**Time**: 30 minutes

**Implementation**:
- Create class with comprehensive sensitive data patterns
- Implement recursive object sanitization
- Add performance optimization for large objects
- Include configurable redaction patterns

**Key Features**:
- Automatic detection of passwords, tokens, keys, secrets
- Recursive sanitization of nested objects
- Performance-optimized with caching
- Configurable redaction patterns

### 2. Implement LogFormatter with structured JSON output
**File**: `backend/infrastructure/logging/LogFormatter.js`
**Time**: 30 minutes

**Implementation**:
- Create structured JSON formatter
- Add timestamp formatting with ISO 8601
- Implement correlation ID generation
- Add service context injection

**Key Features**:
- Structured JSON output for machine readability
- ISO 8601 timestamp formatting
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Service context and metadata injection

### 3. Build LogTransport with automatic encryption
**File**: `backend/infrastructure/logging/LogTransport.js`
**Time**: 45 minutes

**Implementation**:
- Create custom Winston transport
- Integrate with LogEncryptionService
- Add automatic file rotation
- Implement secure file permissions

**Key Features**:
- Automatic encryption of all log entries
- File rotation with size and time limits
- Secure file permissions (600)
- Integration with existing encryption service

### 4. Create LogManager for centralized control
**File**: `backend/infrastructure/logging/LogManager.js`
**Time**: 30 minutes

**Implementation**:
- Create singleton LogManager class
- Implement log level management
- Add transport configuration
- Create log statistics tracking

**Key Features**:
- Centralized logging configuration
- Dynamic log level adjustment
- Transport management
- Log statistics and metrics

### 5. Set up log rotation and retention policies
**File**: `backend/infrastructure/logging/LogRotationManager.js`
**Time**: 15 minutes

**Implementation**:
- Create log rotation manager
- Implement size-based rotation
- Add time-based rotation
- Create retention policy enforcement

**Key Features**:
- Automatic log file rotation
- Configurable retention policies
- Compression of old log files
- Cleanup of expired logs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] LogSanitizer detects and redacts sensitive data
- [ ] LogFormatter produces structured JSON output
- [ ] LogTransport encrypts all log entries
- [ ] LogManager provides centralized control
- [ ] Log rotation works automatically
- [ ] All components have unit tests

## Dependencies
- Winston logger library
- Node.js crypto module
- Existing LogEncryptionService
- File system operations

## Testing
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for sanitization
- Performance tests for large objects
- Security tests for encryption

## Next Phase
Phase 2: Security & Sanitization - Enhance security features and implement comprehensive data protection.
