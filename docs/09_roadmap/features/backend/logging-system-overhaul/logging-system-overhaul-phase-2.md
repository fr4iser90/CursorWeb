- Blocks: Phase 3 start

## Technical Specifications

### LogManager Features
```javascript
class LogManager {
  constructor() {
    this.loggers = new Map();
    this.config = {};
    this.metrics = new LogMetrics();
    this.health = new LogHealth();
  }

  // Logger management
  createLogger(service, options = {}) { /* implementation */ }
  getLogger(service) { /* implementation */ }
  removeLogger(service) { /* implementation */ }
  
  // Configuration
  updateConfig(config) { /* implementation */ }
  getConfig() { /* implementation */ }
  
  // Metrics and health
  getMetrics() { /* implementation */ }
  getHealth() { /* implementation */ }
  
  // Global operations
  setLevel(level) { /* implementation */ }
  flush() { /* implementation */ }
  shutdown() { /* implementation */ }
}
```

### LogRotator Features
- Size-based rotation (default: 10MB)
- Time-based rotation (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Automatic compression of old logs
- Configurable retention policies
- Archive management
- Cleanup of expired logs

### LogEncryption Features
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive logs
- Key rotation and management
- Encrypted file transport
- Secure key storage
- Decryption utilities for authorized access

### LogMetrics Features
- Log volume tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Service-specific analytics
- Trend analysis
- Alert generation

### LogTransport Features
- Multiple output destinations
- Buffered writing for performance
- Error handling and retry logic
- Transport health monitoring
- Dynamic transport configuration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] LogManager providing centralized control
- [ ] Automatic log rotation working correctly
- [ ] Log encryption functional and secure
- [ ] Metrics collection and analytics active
- [ ] Multiple transport options available
- [ ] Compression and archiving working
- [ ] Health monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] All unit tests passing (95% coverage)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied

## Risk Mitigation
- **Encryption Overhead**: Use efficient algorithms and async operations
- **Storage Space**: Implement aggressive rotation and compression
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation procedures
- **Performance Impact**: Buffered writes and async operations

## Configuration Examples

### Log Rotation Configuration
```javascript
const rotationConfig = {
  size: '10m',
  interval: '1d',
  maxFiles: 14,
  compress: true,
  archive: true,
  retention: '30d'
};
```

### Encryption Configuration
```javascript
const encryptionConfig = {
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
  keyRotation: '7d',
  keyStorage: 'secure',
  encryptLevels: ['error', 'warn', 'info']
};
```

### Metrics Configuration
```javascript
const metricsConfig = {
  collection: true,
  interval: '1m',
  retention: '7d',
  alerts: {
    errorRate: 0.05,
    volumeSpike: 2.0
  }
};
```

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Advanced features must be complete and tested
- All transports must be functional
- Encryption must be secure and tested
- Metrics must be collecting data correctly
