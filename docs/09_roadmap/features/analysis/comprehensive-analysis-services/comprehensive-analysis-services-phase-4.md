## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Advanced Security Auditing (3 hours)
1. **Implement AdvancedSecurityAuditing.js**
   - Integrate OWASP ZAP for web application security testing
   - Use Trivy for container and dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Implement secret scanning for sensitive data detection
   - Perform SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - Generate comprehensive security reports

2. **Key features:**
   ```javascript
   class AdvancedSecurityAuditing extends BaseAnalysisService {
     async performSecurityAudit(projectPath, options) {
       // Run OWASP ZAP scans
       // Execute Trivy vulnerability scans
       // Perform secret scanning
       // Conduct SAST analysis
       // Generate security report
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Security scanning capabilities:**
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
   - Container image vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability assessment
   - Secret and credential detection
   - Code security analysis
   - Security configuration validation

### Step 2: Cloud Cost Analyzer (2 hours)
1. **Implement CloudCostAnalyzer.js**
   - Analyze cloud resource usage and costs
   - Identify cost optimization opportunities
   - Assess resource efficiency
   - Generate cost reduction recommendations
   - Implement FinOps best practices

2. **Key features:**
   - Cloud resource cost analysis
   - Usage optimization recommendations
   - Reserved instance analysis
   - Storage cost optimization
   - Network cost assessment
   - FinOps maturity evaluation

3. **Supported cloud providers:**
   - AWS cost analysis
   - Azure cost optimization
   - Google Cloud cost assessment
   - Multi-cloud cost comparison

### Step 3: Developer Experience Analyzer (1 hour)
1. **Implement DeveloperExperienceAnalyzer.js**
   - Analyze development workflow efficiency
   - Assess developer productivity metrics
   - Evaluate tooling and automation
   - Measure development velocity
   - Generate DX improvement recommendations

2. **Key features:**
   - Development workflow analysis
   - Productivity metrics assessment
   - Tooling efficiency evaluation
   - Automation maturity analysis
   - Developer satisfaction metrics

3. **Analysis areas:**
   - Build and deployment times
   - Code review processes
   - Testing automation
   - Documentation accessibility
   - Development environment setup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All security and cost analysis services implemented and functional
- [ ] Services integrated with AnalysisQueueService
- [ ] New API endpoints available and tested
- [ ] Security scanning integration tests pass
- [ ] Services follow established architectural patterns
- [ ] Performance requirements met (< 60 seconds per analysis)
- [ ] Error handling and logging implemented consistently
- [ ] Documentation updated for new services

## Risk Mitigation
- **Security Scanning**: Implement proper access controls and rate limiting
- **External APIs**: Add fallback mechanisms and error handling
- **Performance Impact**: Use caching and incremental scanning
- **Data Sensitivity**: Implement secure handling of sensitive information

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each analyzer independently with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service integration with external security tools
3. **Security Tests**: Validate security scanning accuracy and coverage
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify analysis completion within time limits

## API Endpoints to Add
```javascript
// New endpoints in AnalysisController
POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/security-audit
POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/cloud-cost
POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/developer-experience
```

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 60 seconds for individual analysis (longer due to security scanning)
- **Memory Usage**: < 1GB per analysis operation
- **Concurrent Operations**: Support 2 concurrent analysis operations
- **Caching**: Cache results for 2 hours

## Security Considerations
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of sensitive security data
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of external security APIs
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security analysis activities

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all public methods
- [ ] API documentation for new endpoints
- [ ] Security configuration guide
- [ ] Cost optimization best practices
- [ ] Developer experience improvement guide

## Integration Points
1. **AnalysisQueueService**: Add new analysis types with appropriate timeouts
2. **AnalysisController**: Add new endpoints with proper validation
3. **ServiceRegistry**: Register new services with proper dependencies
4. **Database**: Store analysis results with security metadata

## External Tool Integration
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security testing
- **Trivy**: Container and dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Cloud Provider APIs**: Cost and usage analysis
- **FinOps Tools**: Cost optimization recommendations

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Phase 5 requires all security and cost services to be functional
- Security scanning must be working and tested
- API endpoints must be working and tested
- Integration with existing infrastructure must be complete
