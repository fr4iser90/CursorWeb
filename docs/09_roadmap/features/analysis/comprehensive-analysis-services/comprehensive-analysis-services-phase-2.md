## Dependencies
- Requires: Phase 1 completion (BaseAnalysisService, core analyzers)
- Blocks: Phase 3 start (Analysis Orchestration)
- External: ESLint, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Lighthouse

## Estimated Time
8 hours

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Code Quality Analyzer (3 hours)
1. **Implement CodeQualityAnalyzer.js**
   - Analyze code complexity metrics
   - Check code style consistency
   - Detect code smells and anti-patterns
   - Analyze maintainability index
   - Generate quality improvement suggestions

2. **Key features:**
   - Cyclomatic complexity analysis
   - Code duplication detection
   - Naming convention validation
   - Function length analysis
   - Comment coverage analysis
   - Code style consistency checking

### Step 2: Security Analyzer (3 hours)
1. **Implement SecurityAnalyzer.js**
   - Vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP
   - Dependency security analysis
   - Code security pattern detection
   - Configuration security validation
   - Security best practices assessment

2. **Key features:**
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability analysis
   - Security configuration validation
   - Code injection vulnerability detection
   - Authentication/authorization analysis
   - Data encryption validation

### Step 3: Performance Analyzer (2 hours)
1. **Implement PerformanceAnalyzer.js**
   - Performance bottleneck detection
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Database query optimization
   - Frontend performance analysis
   - Caching strategy evaluation

2. **Key features:**
   - Performance profiling
   - Memory leak detection
   - Database query analysis
   - Frontend performance metrics
   - Caching effectiveness analysis
   - Resource optimization suggestions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All advanced analysis services implemented and functional
- [ ] Services integrated with existing analysis infrastructure
- [ ] AnalysisQueueService supports new analysis types
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass successfully
- [ ] Error handling and logging implemented consistently
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 30 seconds per analysis)

## Risk Mitigation
- **External Tool Dependencies**: Add fallback mechanisms for unavailable tools
- **Performance Impact**: Implement caching and result persistence
- **Security Scanning**: Handle sensitive data appropriately
- **Integration Complexity**: Follow existing service patterns exactly

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each analyzer independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service integration with queue
3. **Performance Tests**: Verify analysis performance
4. **Security Tests**: Test with various security configurations
5. **Error Handling Tests**: Test failure scenarios

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all public methods
- [ ] Configuration guide for each analyzer
- [ ] Security scanning setup guide
- [ ] Performance analysis guide
- [ ] Integration documentation

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Phase 3 requires all advanced services to be functional
- Service integration must be complete
- Analysis result aggregation must be working
- Performance requirements must be met
