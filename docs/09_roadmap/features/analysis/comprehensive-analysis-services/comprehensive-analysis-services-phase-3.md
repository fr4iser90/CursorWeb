## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Analysis Orchestrator (2 hours)
1. **Implement AnalysisOrchestrator.js**
   - Coordinate multiple analysis services
   - Manage analysis execution order
   - Handle dependencies between analyses
   - Provide unified analysis interface
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms

2. **Key features:**
   - Parallel analysis execution where possible
   - Dependency management between analyzers
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Resource management and optimization

### Step 2: Analysis Result Aggregator (1.5 hours)
1. **Implement AnalysisResultAggregator.js**
   - Aggregate results from multiple analyzers
   - Generate comprehensive reports
   - Provide insights and recommendations
   - Create executive summaries
   - Format results for different audiences

2. **Key features:**
   - Multi-analyzer result aggregation
   - Insight generation and prioritization
   - Report formatting and customization
   - Recommendation scoring and ranking
   - Executive summary generation

### Step 3: Analysis Cache Service (1 hour)
1. **Implement AnalysisCacheService.js**
   - Cache analysis results for performance
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies
   - Provide cache statistics and monitoring
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Handle cache persistence

2. **Key features:**
   - Result caching with TTL
   - Cache invalidation on file changes
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Cache statistics and monitoring
   - Persistent cache storage

### Step 4: API Endpoints (1 hour)
1. **Enhance AnalysisController.js**
   - Add comprehensive analysis endpoints
   - Implement batch analysis capabilities
   - Add progress tracking endpoints
   - Provide result retrieval endpoints
   - Add analysis configuration endpoints

2. **Key endpoints:**
   ```javascript
   POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/comprehensive
   GET /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/progress
   GET /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/results
   POST /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/batch
   GET /api/projects/:projectId/analysis/reports
   ```

### Step 5: WebSocket Integration (0.5 hours)
1. **Implement AnalysisWebSocket.js**
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Analysis status notifications
   - Result streaming capabilities
   - Error notifications
   - Connection management

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AnalysisOrchestrator coordinates all analysis services successfully
- [ ] Result aggregation provides comprehensive insights
- [ ] Caching improves performance by >50%
- [ ] API endpoints are fully functional and tested
- [ ] WebSocket provides real-time updates
- [ ] Integration tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] E2E tests validate complete workflow
- [ ] Performance requirements are met (< 5 minutes for comprehensive analysis)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Orchestration Complexity**: Implement robust error handling and recovery
- **Performance Impact**: Use caching and parallel execution
- **Memory Usage**: Implement streaming and cleanup mechanisms
- **WebSocket Reliability**: Add reconnection and fallback mechanisms

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each orchestration component independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Test service coordination and communication
3. **API Tests**: Test all endpoints with various scenarios
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify caching and optimization effectiveness
5. **E2E Tests**: Test complete analysis workflow
6. **WebSocket Tests**: Test real-time communication

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] API documentation for all endpoints
- [ ] Orchestration configuration guide
- [ ] Caching strategy documentation
- [ ] WebSocket integration guide
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

## Next Phase Dependencies
- All analysis services must be functional
- Service integration must be complete
- Performance requirements must be met
- API endpoints must be tested and working
