## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Cloud Cost Analyzer
```javascript
class CloudCostAnalyzer {
  async analyzeCloudCosts(projectPath) {
    return {
      resourceUsage: await this.analyzeResourceUsage(),
      costOptimization: await this.generateCostOptimizationRecommendations(),
      unusedResources: await this.detectUnusedResources(),
      reservedInstances: await this.analyzeReservedInstances(),
      storageCosts: await this.analyzeStorageCosts(),
      networkCosts: await this.analyzeNetworkCosts(),
      costTrends: await this.analyzeCostTrends(),
      recommendations: await this.generateRecommendations()
    };
  }
}
```

### Developer Experience Analyzer
```javascript
class DeveloperExperienceAnalyzer {
  async analyzeDeveloperExperience(projectPath) {
    return {
      developmentEnvironment: await this.analyzeDevelopmentEnvironment(),
      toolIntegration: await this.analyzeToolIntegration(),
      workflowEfficiency: await this.analyzeWorkflowEfficiency(),
      documentationQuality: await this.assessDocumentationQuality(),
      onboardingExperience: await this.analyzeOnboardingExperience(),
      developerSatisfaction: await this.measureDeveloperSatisfaction(),
      productivityBottlenecks: await this.identifyProductivityBottlenecks(),
      recommendations: await this.generateRecommendations()
    };
  }
}
```

## üìÅ Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
- [ ] `backend/domain/services/CloudCostAnalyzer.js`
- [ ] `backend/domain/services/DeveloperExperienceAnalyzer.js`
- [ ] `tests/unit/services/CloudCostAnalyzer.test.js`
- [ ] `tests/unit/services/DeveloperExperienceAnalyzer.test.js`
- [ ] `docs/analysis-toolbase-user-guide.md`
- [ ] `docs/analysis-toolbase-api-reference.md`
- [ ] `docs/analysis-toolbase-architecture.md`

### Files to Modify:
- [ ] `backend/domain/services/AnalysisOrchestrator.js` - Final integration
- [ ] `backend/presentation/api/analysis/` - Final endpoints
- [ ] `backend/infrastructure/database/` - Final schemas
- [ ] `README.md` - Update with new analysis capabilities

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Comprehensive Testing:
- [ ] All 10 analyzers functional testing
- [ ] End-to-end analysis workflow testing
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security testing and validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Integration Testing:
- [ ] Full system integration testing
- [ ] Database integration validation
- [ ] API endpoint testing
- [ ] Frontend integration testing

## üìà Success Metrics
- [ ] All 10 analyzers implemented and functional
- [ ] 95%+ analysis coverage of all development aspects
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for all analyzers
- [ ] Performance requirements met (< 30 seconds for full analysis)
