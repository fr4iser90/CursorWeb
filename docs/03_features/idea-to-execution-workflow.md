# Interactive mode
node scripts/workflows/idea-to-execution.js --interactive

# Read idea from file
node scripts/workflows/idea-to-execution.js --file my-idea.txt
```

#### Examples
```bash
# Simple feature idea
node scripts/workflows/idea-to-execution.js "Add dark mode to the application"

# Complex system idea
node scripts/workflows/idea-to-execution.js "Implement a microservices architecture with Docker and Kubernetes"

# Interactive mode for complex ideas
node scripts/workflows/idea-to-execution.js --interactive
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
const { IdeaToExecutionWorkflow } = require('./backend/domain/workflows/steps');

const workflow = new IdeaToExecutionWorkflow();

const result = await workflow.execute({
  idea: "Create a REST API for user management",
  projectId: "my-project",
  userId: "user123",
  automationLevel: "semi_auto"
});

console.log('Workflow completed:', result);
```

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Idea Refinement
**Purpose**: Transform raw ideas into detailed specifications

**AI Processing**:
- Analyzes idea complexity and scope
- Expands technical requirements
- Identifies potential challenges
- Defines success criteria
- Suggests implementation approach

**Output**: Structured idea with detailed specifications

### 2. Task Creation
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive tasks from refined ideas

**Process**:
- Generates task title and description
- Defines technical requirements
- Sets appropriate priority and type
- Configures automation level
- Establishes project context

**Output**: Created task with full metadata

### 3. Task Review & Splitting
**Purpose**: Break complex tasks into manageable subtasks

**AI Analysis**:
- Evaluates task complexity
- Identifies logical boundaries
- Determines dependencies
- Estimates effort for each subtask
- Suggests optimal execution order

**Output**: Multiple subtasks with dependencies

### 4. Execution
**Purpose**: Execute all subtasks with proper management

**Process**:
- Executes subtasks in priority order
- Manages dependencies between tasks
- Monitors progress and performance
- Handles errors gracefully
- Collects execution results

**Output**: Complete execution report with statistics

## Configuration

### Automation Levels
- **manual** - Full manual control
- **assisted** - AI suggestions with manual approval
- **semi_auto** - Automated execution with manual oversight
- **full_auto** - Fully automated execution
- **adaptive** - AI determines optimal automation level

### Task Types
- **feature** - New feature development
- **bugfix** - Bug fixes and corrections
- **refactor** - Code refactoring
- **documentation** - Documentation updates
- **testing** - Test creation and updates
- **deployment** - Deployment and infrastructure

### Priority Levels
- **critical** - Immediate attention required
- **high** - Important, should be done soon
- **medium** - Normal priority
- **low** - Can be done when convenient

## Output Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "originalIdea": "Create a user authentication system",
  "refinedIdea": {
    "title": "User Authentication System",
    "description": "Complete authentication system with JWT tokens",
    "requirements": ["JWT implementation", "Password hashing", "Session management"],
    "expectedOutcomes": ["Secure user login", "Token-based authentication"],

      "success": true,
      "result": "JWT implementation completed"
    }
  ],
  "workflow": "idea-to-execution"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Ideas
1. **Be Specific** - Include technical details and requirements
2. **Define Scope** - Clearly state what should be included/excluded
3. **Mention Context** - Provide relevant project or system context
4. **State Goals** - Explain what you want to achieve
5. **Consider Constraints** - Mention any limitations or requirements

### Example Good Ideas
```
‚úÖ "Create a REST API for user management with JWT authentication, 
    password hashing, and role-based access control for the e-commerce platform"

‚úÖ "Implement a dark mode feature for the React frontend with theme 
    persistence and smooth transitions"

‚úÖ "Set up automated testing pipeline with Jest, Cypress, and GitHub 
    Actions for the Node.js backend"
```

### Example Poor Ideas
```
‚ùå "Make it better" (too vague)
‚ùå "Fix the bug" (no context)
‚ùå "Add everything" (no scope)
```
