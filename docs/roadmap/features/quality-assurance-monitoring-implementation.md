- [ ] Build PerformanceMonitor
- [ ] Create SecurityTestingService
- [ ] Implement QualityGateService

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Integrate with existing automation system
- [ ] Connect with monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Update frontend with quality dashboard
- [ ] Test integration points

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive quality tests

- [ ] Create quality assurance guide

### Phase 5: Deployment & Validation
- [ ] Deploy quality assurance services
- [ ] Perform quality validation testing
- [ ] Fix any issues
- [ ] Deploy to staging

## 5. Code Standards & Patterns
- **Coding Style**: ESLint with Airbnb config, Prettier formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with specific error types, graceful degradation
- **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging, quality-specific levels
- **Testing**: Jest with 85% coverage requirement
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods, quality assurance guides

## 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] Security scan result protection
- [ ] Performance data security
- [ ] Visual test data isolation
- [ ] Quality metrics access control
- [ ] Secure reporting endpoints
- [ ] Data retention policies

## 7. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 60 seconds for full quality scan
- **Throughput**: 50+ concurrent quality assessments
- **Memory Usage**: < 300MB for quality system
- **Database Queries**: Optimized quality metrics queries
- **Caching Strategy**: Quality results cache, performance baseline cache

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/testing/VisualTestingService.test.js`
- [ ] Test cases: Screenshot comparison, visual regression detection, diff analysis
- [ ] Mock requirements: Playwright, file system, image processing

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `backend/tests/integration/QualityAssurance.test.js`
- [ ] Test scenarios: Full quality workflow, performance monitoring, security scanning
- [ ] Test data: Mock applications, performance baselines, security test cases

### E2E Tests:
- [ ] Test file: `backend/tests/e2e/QualityAssuranceE2E.test.js`
- [ ] User flows: Complete quality assessment, performance monitoring, security validation
- [ ] Browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## 9. Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation:
- [ ] JSDoc comments for all quality services
- [ ] README updates for quality system
- [ ] API documentation for quality endpoints
- [ ] Architecture diagrams for quality flow

### User Documentation:
- [ ] Quality assurance user guide
- [ ] Performance monitoring guide
- [ ] Security testing guide
- [ ] Quality metrics interpretation guide

## 10. Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment:
- [ ] All quality tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security review passed

### Deployment:
- [ ] Quality services deployed
- [ ] Monitoring tools configured
- [ ] Security scanning tools installed
- [ ] Configuration updated
- [ ] Health checks passing

### Post-deployment:
- [ ] Monitor quality system performance
- [ ] Verify quality assessments
- [ ] Test performance monitoring
- [ ] Collect quality metrics

## 11. Rollback Plan
- [ ] Quality service rollback procedure
- [ ] Monitoring configuration rollback
- [ ] Security tool configuration rollback
- [ ] Communication plan for users

## 12. Success Criteria
- [ ] Visual testing detects regressions accurately
- [ ] Performance monitoring tracks metrics correctly
- [ ] Security testing identifies vulnerabilities
- [ ] Quality gates prevent regressions
- [ ] 85% test coverage achieved
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] No false positive quality alerts

## 13. Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- [ ] False positive visual regressions - Implement baseline management and tolerance settings
- [ ] Performance monitoring overhead - Optimize monitoring frequency and data collection

### Medium Risk:
- [ ] Security scan false positives - Add result validation and manual review process
- [ ] Quality gate complexity - Provide clear documentation and configuration options

### Low Risk:
- [ ] Minor UI display issues - Add error boundaries and graceful degradation
- [ ] Configuration complexity - Provide clear documentation and examples
