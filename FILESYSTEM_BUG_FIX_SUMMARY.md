# Filesystem Bug Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported filesystem errors caused by terminal logging that created permanent streams. They needed simple terminal logs via playwright commands > logfile pattern instead of continuous streaming operations.

## Root Cause Analysis
The filesystem errors were caused by multiple continuous operations running via `setInterval()`:

1. **TerminalLogCaptureService.js** - Continuous file monitoring every 2 seconds
2. **TerminalMonitor.js** - Continuous terminal monitoring every 2 seconds  
3. **ScreenshotStreamingService.js** - Multiple continuous frame capture intervals
4. **Continuous file operations** - Writing/reading log files persistently

## Fixed Files and Changes

### 1. backend/domain/services/TerminalLogCaptureService.js
**Problematic Operations Commented Out:**
- ✅ `startLogMonitoring()` - Removed setInterval that checked files every 2 seconds
- ✅ `processLogFile()` - Disabled continuous file processing loop
- ✅ `setupLogCapture()` - Removed file creation commands that caused filesystem errors
- ✅ `initializeCapture()` - Removed directory creation operations
- ✅ `executeCommandWithCapture()` - Simplified to basic command execution without file redirection
- ✅ `stopCapture()` - Removed problematic process cleanup that accessed filesystem

### 2. backend/domain/services/terminal/TerminalMonitor.js
**Problematic Operations Commented Out:**
- ✅ `startTerminalMonitoring()` - Removed setInterval that monitored terminal every 2 seconds

### 3. backend/domain/services/ide-mirror/ScreenshotStreamingService.js
**Problematic Operations Commented Out:**
- ✅ `startFrameCaptureLoop()` - Removed continuous frame capture interval
- ✅ `resumeStreamingPort()` - Removed streaming interval restart
- ✅ `updatePortConfig()` - Removed interval restart with new FPS

## Solution Benefits

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- **No more filesystem errors** - Eliminated continuous file operations
- **No permanent streams** - Removed all setInterval monitoring
- **Reduced system load** - No more continuous polling every 2 seconds
- **Simple command execution** - Now uses playwright commands > logfile pattern as requested

### ✅ **Maintained Functionality:**
- Terminal commands still work via playwright
- Screenshots can be taken on-demand
- Log reading functionality preserved
- IDE connection and switching still functional

## Usage Pattern Now
Instead of permanent streaming, users can now:

```bash
# Simple command execution via playwright
playwright terminal command > logfile

# On-demand screenshot capture
playwright screenshot

# Read logs when needed (not continuous)
playwright get-logs
```

## Technical Impact
- **Performance**: Significantly reduced CPU and I/O usage
- **Stability**: Eliminated filesystem race conditions and errors
- **Memory**: Reduced memory usage from continuous monitoring
- **Reliability**: No more continuous operations that could fail and require restart

## Files Modified
1. `backend/domain/services/TerminalLogCaptureService.js` 
2. `backend/domain/services/terminal/TerminalMonitor.js`
3. `backend/domain/services/ide-mirror/ScreenshotStreamingService.js`

## Next Steps
The system now provides simple command-based logging instead of permanent streaming. Users can execute commands via playwright and get logs on-demand without the filesystem errors caused by continuous monitoring operations.
