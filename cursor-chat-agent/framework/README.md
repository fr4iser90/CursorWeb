# Cursor Chat Agent Framework

## Overview
This framework provides comprehensive documentation, patterns, and guidelines for building applications with the Cursor Chat Agent system. It serves as a reference for developers working on web applications, mobile apps, extensions, and various architectural patterns.

## Structure

### üìÅ Domains
Application-specific patterns and guidelines for different types of projects:
- **Web Apps**: CRUD applications, e-commerce platforms, dashboards, social media, streaming platforms
- **Mobile Apps**: Android and iOS applications with modern patterns
- **Extensions**: IDE extensions and plugins

### üìÅ Patterns
Architectural and design patterns for building robust applications:
- **Architectural**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Design**: Singleton, Observer, Factory, Strategy patterns

### üìÅ Tech Stacks
Technology stack configurations and best practices:
- **Web**: React, Vue.js with modern development patterns
- **Mobile**: Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) and iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) development stacks

### üìÅ General
General guidelines, standards, and AI agent instructions:
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design
- **Code Style**: Coding standards and conventions
- **AI Instructions**: Special files for directing the Cursor Chat Agent

## AI Agent Instructions

### Code-Only Instructions (`general/code-only.md`)
Use for direct code modifications without explanations:
- Bug fixes and quick patches
- Simple refactoring tasks
- Adding new functions or classes
- Performance optimizations

### Code Documentation (`general/doc-code.md`)
Use for code-related documentation:
- API documentation and JSDoc comments
- README files for libraries and components
- Code examples and usage guides
- Technical specifications

### General Documentation (`general/doc-general.md`)
Use for project-wide documentation:
- Project setup and installation guides
- Architecture documentation
- Deployment and CI/CD instructions
- Contributing guidelines and project overviews

## Usage

### For New Projects
1. Choose the appropriate domain folder for your project type
2. Reference the relevant tech stack documentation
3. Apply architectural patterns as needed
4. Follow general guidelines for accessibility and code style
5. Use AI instruction files to guide development

### For Existing Projects
1. Review patterns for refactoring opportunities
2. Update tech stack documentation as needed
3. Ensure compliance with accessibility standards
4. Maintain consistent code style
5. Leverage AI instructions for maintenance tasks

## Documentation Types

### Domain-Specific Patterns
Each domain contains specialized patterns and best practices:
- **Web Apps**: Modern web development patterns, state management, API integration
- **Mobile Apps**: Native development patterns, platform-specific considerations
- **Extensions**: IDE integration patterns, extension development lifecycle

### Architectural Patterns
Foundation patterns for building scalable applications:
- **DDD**: Domain modeling, bounded contexts, aggregate design
- **MVC**: Separation of concerns, data flow management

### Design Patterns
Reusable solutions for common programming problems:
- **Singleton**: Global state management, resource sharing
- **Observer**: Event handling, reactive programming
- **Factory**: Object creation, dependency management
- **Strategy**: Algorithm selection, behavior switching

### Tech Stack Guides
Comprehensive guides for modern development stacks:
- **React**: Hooks, Context API, performance optimization
- **Vue**: Composition API, Pinia, modern Vue patterns
- **Android**: MVVM, Jetpack Compose, Room database
- **iOS**: SwiftUI, Combine, Core Data integration

## Contributing
When adding new patterns or tech stacks:
1. Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions
2. Use clear, concise documentation with practical examples
3. Include code samples and implementation details
4. Maintain consistency with existing patterns
5. Update this README when adding new categories

## Future Enhancements

### Potential New Categories
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, infrastructure
- **Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, E2E testing patterns
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, security best practices
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques, monitoring, profiling
- **Microservices**: Service architecture, communication patterns
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP integration patterns
- **Database**: SQL, NoSQL, ORM patterns and best practices
- **API Design**: REST, GraphQL, API versioning strategies
