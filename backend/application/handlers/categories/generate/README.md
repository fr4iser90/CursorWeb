# Script Generation Handler - Refactored Architecture

This module has been refactored from a single large file (1120 lines) into smaller, more maintainable modules following the Single Responsibility Principle and separation of concerns.

## Architecture Overview

The refactored architecture consists of the following components:

### Core Handler
- **GenerateScriptHandler.js** - Main handler that orchestrates the script generation process

### Constants and Configuration
- **constants/ScriptGenerationConstants.js** - Centralized configuration for script types, build tools, templates, etc.

### Validation
- **validation/ScriptGenerationValidator.js** - Handles all validation logic for commands and script results

### Services
- **services/ProjectAnalysisService.js** - Analyzes project structure, package.json, existing scripts, and build tools
- **services/ScriptGenerationService.js** - Orchestrates AI-powered script generation using Cursor IDE service
- **services/ScriptProcessingService.js** - Processes, enhances, and saves generated scripts
- **services/TaskManagementService.js** - Manages task and execution record operations
- **services/EventPublishingService.js** - Handles event publishing for script generation lifecycle

## Module Structure

├── index.js                          # Module exports

    ├── ScriptProcessingService.js    # Script processing & enhancement
    ├── TaskManagementService.js      # Task & execution management
    └── EventPublishingService.js     # Event publishing
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns
- Validation is isolated in its own module

### 2. Maintainability
- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear module boundaries reduce coupling
- Constants are centralized and reusable

### 3. Testability
- Each service can be unit tested independently
- Dependencies are injected, making mocking easier
- Validation logic is pure and easily testable

### 4. Reusability
- Services can be reused in other contexts
- Constants can be shared across modules
- Validation can be used by other handlers

## Usage

```javascript
const { GenerateScriptHandler } = require('./generate');

const handler = new GenerateScriptHandler({
    scriptGenerationService,
    cursorIDEService,
    taskRepository,
    taskExecutionRepository,
    eventBus,
    logger,
    projectAnalyzer,
    fileSystemService
});

const result = await handler.handle(command);
```

## Migration Notes

- All original functionality has been preserved
- The main handler interface remains the same
- Dependencies are now injected into individual services
- Error handling and logging patterns are consistent across services

## Testing

Each module can be tested independently:

```javascript
const { ScriptGenerationValidator } = require('./generate');

// Test validation
const result = ScriptGenerationValidator.validateCommand(command);
```

## Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new script types by updating constants
- Implement new validation rules
- Add new project analysis capabilities
- Extend script processing with new enhancements
- Add new event types for monitoring
